# Hi, I’m Harish D N

I’m currently pursuing a **PhD in Cosmology**, with a focus on understanding the **early universe**. My research primarily explores **Primordial Black Hole (PBH) production** in **inflationary models**, aiming to understand the origins of universe.

## 🔬 Research Interests
- Inflationary Cosmology
- Primordial Black Holes (PBHs)
- Early Universe Phenomenology
- Modeling & Simulations in Cosmology

Feel free to explore my repositories, where I share my research, simulations, and code related to cosmological models. If you have any questions or want to collaborate, don’t hesitate to reach out!
