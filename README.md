# Hi, Iâ€™m Harish D N ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a **PhD in Cosmology**, with a focus on understanding the **early universe**. My research primarily explores **Primordial Black Hole (PBH) production** in **inflationary models**, aiming to understand the origins of universe.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
- Primordial Black Holes (PBHs)
- Inflationary Cosmology
- Early Universe Phenomenology
- Computational Modeling & Simulations in Cosmology

Feel free to explore my repositories, where I share my research, simulations, and code related to cosmological models. If you have any questions or want to collaborate, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
